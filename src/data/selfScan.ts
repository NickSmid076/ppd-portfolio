export const ofmanReflection = `
This Offman quadrant provides insight into which competencies and attitudes I possess, but also shows what possible threats could be if these go to the extreme. I do recognize it to some extent. A practical example is with system mapping: when I explained to my parents how to resolve something as simple as a bug in a website, I tended to go into the whole system behind it that ultimately leads to the end goal. This showcases that keeping things practical is an aspect I tend to neglect.
